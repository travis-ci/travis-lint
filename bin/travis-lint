  This may happen if you're using rubygems as your package manager, but it is not
  being required through some mechanism before executing the travis-lint command.

  You may need to do one of the following in your shell:

    # for bash/zsh
    export RUBYOPT=rubygems

    # for csh, etc.
    set RUBYOPT=rubygems

  For background, please see http://gist.github.com/54177.
#{'*'*50}
  EOS

  raise e

  exit(1)
end
