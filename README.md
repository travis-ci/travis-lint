# What is travis-lint

Supporting the gem, there's also an online version of this tool at [lint.travis-ci.org](http://lint.travis-ci.org).

The library functions of `travis-lint` has been superseded by [`travis-yml`](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-yml).
The command line utility `travis-lint` is now available as [`travis lint`](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#lint).
